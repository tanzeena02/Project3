# Sephora skincare Price, Rating and Skin Type Analysis: uncovering value vs. luxury in skincare products
## Summary: This project analyzes over 300+ Sephora moisturizer products to understand how factors such as brand popularity, pricing, customer rating, and suitability for different skin types influence product positioning and consumer preferences.

Using Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard showing:

Top brands by number of moisturizers (colored by average rating)

Price vs. Rating relationship (does a higher price actually mean better reviews?)

Percentage distribution of moisturizers for each skin type (Combination, Dry, Normal, Oily, Sensitive)

Overall price distribution to identify affordability ranges and luxury clusters

Key insights include:

Popular brands like Clinique, Sephora Collection, Shiseido, and Origins offer the largest number of products.

Higher-priced products do not always correlate with higher customer ratings.

Most moisturizers are formulated for Combination and Dry skin, while Sensitive-skin products are less common.

The price distribution shows a large concentration of moisturizers under $60, with luxury outliers exceeding $200–$350.

This analysis helps uncover market gaps, consumer behavior trends, and brand-level value propositions—useful for both business strategy and retail product assortment optimization.
