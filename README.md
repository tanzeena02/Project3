# Sephora Skincare Price, Rating & Skin Type Analysis
A Tableau Data Visualization Project by Afroza Tanzeena

## ⭐ Project Overview

This project analyzes over 1,000 Sephora moisturizers, exploring how price, customer ratings, brand popularity, and skin-type suitability interact in the beauty retail market.

As someone currently working at Sephora, I wanted to choose a dataset aligned with my industry experience while strengthening my Tableau Public and data visualization skills.

This end-to-end project includes:

Data cleaning and preparation

Visual exploration of product trends

Multi-chart Tableau dashboard

Insights relevant to beauty retail, merchandising, and customer behavior

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Identify top-performing skincare brands based on product variety.
2. Examine how pricing influences customer ratings.
3. Analyze product suitability for different skin types.
4. Explore the price distribution across the moisturizers category.
5. Build an interactive Tableau dashboard with multiple visual components.

## 🧼 Dataset

The dataset includes the following fields:

Brand

Label / Product Type

Price

Rank (Customer Rating)

Skin Type Flags: Combination, Dry, Normal, Oily, Sensitive

Ingredients

Additional supporting attributes

Source: Public skincare dataset (cleaned and structured for analysis).

## 📈 Visualizations Included

This Tableau dashboard contains five key charts, each revealing a different perspective:

1️⃣ Top Brands by Number of Moisturizers

Bar chart showing brand assortment size, colored by average rating.

2️⃣ Percentage of Moisturizers Suitable for Each Skin Type

100% stacked bar chart showing how brands distribute products across Combination, Dry, Normal, Oily, and Sensitive needs.

3️⃣ Price vs Customer Rating Scatterplot

Reveals that higher price does not guarantee higher customer ratings.

4️⃣ Top 10 Highest-Rated Moisturizers

A ranked view of the strongest performers, showing price and rating together.

5️⃣ Price Distribution Histogram

Highlights price clusters across the category, showing most products fall in the $20–$80 range.

## 🔍 Key Insights

Clinique, Sephora Collection, and Shiseido offer the largest variety of moisturizers.

Customer ratings remain high (4.0–5.0) across both affordable and luxury items.

Price is not a strong predictor of customer satisfaction.

Most products target Combination, Normal, and Dry skin types.

Sensitive skin products are fewer in comparison.

The price distribution skews toward affordable to mid-range, with fewer premium products.
